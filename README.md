# Omega Stikers Stats Nabber (Not the permanent name, open to suggestions!)

**NOTE: This project is not affiliated in any way with Odyssey Interactive**

This is a very early prototype and is not really useful in its current state. Use at your own risk (it doesn't modify any data or interact with the game process at all) but don't expect anything groundbreaking from it (yet...).

## Running

Uses Go 1.21+ but should work fine with older versions.

Until I clean things up, you'll need to change the omega strikers Log Directory before running (Its hardcoded atm so unless your windows user name happens to also be TheBoss, it won't work without changing).

Other than that, just run it (optionally provide the file name as an argument of an old game log if you don't want to use the current game log file) using the command below.

```
go run main.go
```
